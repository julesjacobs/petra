Reachability refers to EF targets or AG counterexamples; `property_truth` in runs.jsonl preserves the original property polarity.
Suite and family membership are preserved in the input manifest. No external verdict is treated as an oracle.
Definitive disagreements: [].
Native witnesses and available certificates are checked independently; per-branch verification status is recorded. External SMPT and VerifyPN proofs are not independently checked. Timings are exploratory on a shared host.
